# Adidas Sale Report 2020 - 2021 Analysis using Excel Dashboard

# About this Proeject

This project analyzes Adidas sales data from 2020–2021 to evaluate performance across regions, retailers, products, pricing strategies, and sales channels. The objective was to identify the primary drivers of revenue and profitability and surface insights that could inform commercial and operational decision-making.

The analysis reveals that sales and profit are highly concentrated across a small number of regions, cities, retailers, and products. While some markets and partners drive strong sales volume, they do not always translate into strong margins, highlighting opportunities for pricing, cost, and channel optimization. Clear seasonal patterns in sales further suggest potential improvements in inventory planning and campaign timing.

An interactive Excel dashboard was developed to allow stakeholders to explore performance by region, retailer, product, and sales method, enabling dynamic filtering and drill-down into key business drivers.

# Analyses derived from the dataset

## Sales and Profit Are Highly Concentrated by Region and City:

- A small number of regions and cities account for a disproportionate share of total sales and profit, with a large concentration in the West and the Northwast. This concentration indicates that growth is currently being driven by specific geographic markets, rather than evenly across the country.

## Total Units Sold by retailer

- Unit sales are dominated by a limited number of retailers with the leaders being Westgear, Footlocker, and Sports Direct respectively.

- The gap between top and mid-tier retailers suggests unequal effectiveness in sell-through. 

## Pricing analysis:

- Pricing effectiveness varies, indicating margin optimization opportunities.
- This suggests inconsistent pricing power and potentially misaligned discounting strategies across partners.

- Monthly sales patterns show predictable peaks and troughs across the two-year period with obvious slowing of purchases being made in during COVID-19 physical store closures, and sharp increase following social-distancing restrictions being lifted.

- This chart shows the profitability of each sales method, such as online sales, in-store sales, and direct sales. This information can be used to identify which sales methods are the most effective and profitable.

## Reccomendations 

### Concentrate Growth Investments in High-Performing Regions and Cities

Sales and profit are heavily concentrated in a small number of regions and cities, indicating that these markets are the primary drivers of overall performance. Management should prioritize marketing spend, inventory availability, and retail support in these high-performing areas rather than distributing resources evenly across lower-impact regions. This targeted approach is likely to generate higher marginal returns on investment.
- Reduce blanket national strategies in favour of geo-targeted growth plans

### Strengthen Strategic Retailer Partnerships
A small subset of retailers accounts for the majority of unit sales, positioning them as critical distribution partners rather than interchangeable channels. Adidas should consider strengthening relationships with these retailers through preferred pricing, exclusive product launches, or joint marketing initiatives. At the same time, consistently underperforming retailers should be reviewed to assess whether they justify continued investment.

### Rationalize the Product Portfolio Around Core Revenue Drivers
Revenue is driven by a limited number of high-performing products, while long-tail items contribute relatively little despite adding operational complexity. Management should evaluate whether lower-performing products can be consolidated, repositioned, or discontinued without materially impacting revenue. Focusing on core products may improve supply chain efficiency and amplify marketing effectiveness.
